# 🚀 Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Description  
This project is a **Machine Learning model** built using Python to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It leverages **Logistic Regression** on the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

## 📌 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📌 Project Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and prepared the dataset.  
2️⃣ **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Analyzed transaction patterns.  
3️⃣ **Balancing Data** – Used **under-sampling** to handle class imbalance.  
4️⃣ **Model Training** – Trained **Logistic Regression** with **91.8% accuracy**.  

## 📌 How to Run  
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Fraud Detection.ipynb`).  
3. Run the notebook to train and test the model.  

## 📌 Dataset
